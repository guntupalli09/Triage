# Use Case: Freelancers

## Target User

Independent contractors and freelancers who receive NDAs and MSAs from clients.

## The Problem

Freelancers face challenges:
- **Limited legal budget**: Can't afford $500-2000 per contract review
- **Frequent contracts**: Multiple clients mean multiple contracts
- **Asymmetric power**: Clients often have stronger negotiating position
- **Risk exposure**: Bad contracts can expose freelancers to liability

## How This Tool Helps

### 1. Affordable Risk Assessment

**Cost**: $5.99 per analysis (vs. $500-2000 for legal review)

**Benefit**: Freelancers can assess contract risk without breaking the bank.

### 2. Identify Problematic Clauses

The tool helps freelancers identify:
- **IP assignment clauses**: May transfer ownership of work
- **Indemnification**: May expose freelancers to client's risks
- **Non-compete**: May limit future work opportunities
- **Confidentiality**: May create long-term restrictions

### 3. Negotiation Guidance

The tool provides:
- **What to negotiate**: Commonly negotiated sections
- **Why it matters**: Business impact explanations
- **Preparation**: Know what to discuss with clients

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Freelancer Receives Client MSA

1. **Upload MSA**: Freelancer receives MSA from new client
2. **Get assessment**: Tool flags 2 high-risk issues:
   - Broad IP assignment
   - Unlimited indemnification
3. **Review findings**: Freelancer reads explanations
4. **Decision**: 
   - **Option A**: Negotiate with client (use findings as talking points)
   - **Option B**: Walk away if client won't negotiate
   - **Option C**: Accept risk if project value justifies it

## Limitations for Freelancers

- **Not legal advice**: Always consult lawyers for final decisions
- **Scope limited**: Optimized for NDAs and MSAs
- **False positives**: May flag standard clauses
- **No negotiation help**: Tool doesn't draft counter-proposals

## Best Practices

1. **Use for screening**: Quick assessment before accepting projects
2. **Negotiate high-risk clauses**: Use findings to guide discussions
3. **Know your limits**: Understand what risks you can accept
4. **Consult lawyers**: For high-risk contracts, get legal review
5. **Document decisions**: Keep records of risk assessments
