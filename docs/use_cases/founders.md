# Use Case: Founders

## Target User

Early-stage founders and CEOs who need to quickly assess contract risk before expensive legal review.

## The Problem

Founders face a dilemma:
- **Legal review is expensive**: $500-2000 per contract review
- **Contracts are frequent**: NDAs, MSAs, vendor agreements
- **Time is limited**: Need quick decisions
- **Risk is real**: Bad contracts can expose companies to significant liability

## How This Tool Helps

### 1. Quick Triage

**Before**: Send contract to lawyer → wait days → pay $500-2000

**After**: Upload contract → get risk assessment in seconds → decide if legal review needed

**Time saved**: Days → seconds
**Cost saved**: $500-2000 per contract (if low-risk)

### 2. Risk Prioritization

The tool helps founders:
- **Identify high-risk contracts**: Flag contracts needing immediate legal review
- **Prioritize legal budget**: Focus expensive review on high-risk contracts
- **Understand risks**: Get business-friendly explanations of what matters

### 3. Negotiation Preparation

The tool helps founders:
- **Understand what to negotiate**: See commonly negotiated sections
- **Prepare for discussions**: Know which clauses to question
- **Set expectations**: Understand what's standard vs. problematic

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: NDA from Potential Partner

1. **Upload NDA**: Founder receives NDA, uploads to tool
2. **Get assessment**: Tool flags 2 medium-risk issues:
   - Indefinite confidentiality
   - Development restrictions
3. **Review findings**: Founder reads explanations:
   - "Indefinite confidentiality may create long-term compliance burden"
   - "Development restrictions may limit future work"
4. **Decision**: 
   - **Option A**: Low risk → sign as-is
   - **Option B**: Medium risk → Quick legal review ($500)
   - **Option C**: High risk → Full legal review ($2000)

### Scenario: MSA from Vendor

1. **Upload MSA**: Founder receives vendor MSA
2. **Get assessment**: Tool flags 1 high-risk issue:
   - Unlimited indemnification
3. **Review findings**: Founder reads explanation:
   - "Unlimited indemnification can expose you to costs far beyond contract value"
4. **Decision**: High risk → Full legal review required
