FINAL SYSTEM NOTES

These rules are triage-grade, not legal judgment

Every rule is:

Deterministic

Auditable

Regex-implementable

Explainable without LLM hallucination

If your system does not include at least 80% of the High-Risk section, it is not production-ready.

If you want:

Regex examples

Clause-section detection logic

Confidence scoring without probability

Rule priority ordering

False-positive suppression strategies

Say so and specify the engine (Python, Rust, SQL, JS).

give me atleast 50 of them so that my tool is effecient for most of the cases

Below is a production-grade expansion to 55 deterministic rules.

This is not fluff.
This is the actual surface area in-house counsel scans when triaging NDAs and MSAs fast.

All rules satisfy:

Deterministic (textual presence / structure)

Regex + proximity friendly

Common in real contracts

Asymmetric or hidden business risk
