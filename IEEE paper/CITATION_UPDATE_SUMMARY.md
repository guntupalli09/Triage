### 1. **b9** (Gómez, 2022) - Rule-based expert systems
   - **Added to**: Related Work section (line 383)
   - **Context**: "Prior work has demonstrated the use of ontology-driven and rule-based systems for structured processing, emphasizing structured rule execution and traceable decision logic\cite{b9,b10}."

### 2. **legalnlp** (Nazarenko & Wyner, 2017) - Legal NLP Introduction
   - **Added to**: Related Work section (line 383)
   - **Context**: "Legal NLP applications have explored rule-based and expert system approaches for contract analysis and legal reasoning\cite{legalnlp}, though systematic evaluation of execution determinism and reproducibility in these systems remains limited."
