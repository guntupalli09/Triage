This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in computational science: achieving 
reproducible execution in pipelines embedding stochastic components like Large 
Language Models (LLMs). Reproducibility requires identical inputs to produce 
identical outputs across repeated executions, enabling verifiable scientific 
workflows.

We present a deterministic execution framework that enforces execution invariance 
by architecturally separating deterministic symbolic components from stochastic LLM 
components, resolving how to integrate modern AI systems while preserving 
reproducibility guarantees required for scientific computing.

The paper contributes: (1) a formal execution state model representing system state 
as a computational object, ensuring execution invariance and providing mathematical 
foundations for reproducible pipelines; (2) reproducibility-oriented evaluation 
metrics (execution determinism, output variance, traceability) treating 
reproducibility as a first-class computational property; (3) verifiable execution 
traces and computational guarantees for scientific workflows requiring deterministic 
execution; (4) architectural design principles enforcing strict boundaries between 
deterministic and stochastic components, preventing probabilistic behavior from 
affecting system state.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates 100% execution determinism and 100% 
traceability across 300 runs with zero output variance, contrasting with 
non-deterministic pure stochastic pipelines. The framework generalizes to any 
computational pipeline requiring reproducible execution with stochastic components, 
making it directly relevant to the computational science community.
